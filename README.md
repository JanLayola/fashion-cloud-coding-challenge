# FashionCloud coding-challenge

Alright, that's what I came up with for the first part of the tech assignment.

I did my best, but time was playing hard to get, so I had to skip a few things to get the code to a point where it feels
kinda done. I really wanted to throw in more tests because, you know, they're like the superheroes of project 
maintainability. Also, I've got this vibe that the component structure could use a bit of TLC, but, it's been two years 
since I coded with Angular, and rediscovering the framework was a great trip.

I hope you can enjoy the code review, and I'm looking forward to discuss in more deep during the next steps.

Have a nice day!
